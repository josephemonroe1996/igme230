        <p>This is a prototype game I made for my capstone class at Tompkins Cortland Community College. I was far behind my classmates in terms of experience, but a fellow student recommended I use Unreal Engine 4 to design a prototype game. So I took the idea and ran with it! It was difficult at first because I had never used UE4 before, nor had I made a game! I was learning new things every week and taught myself how to do everything from map design, character design, interactive events, audio, to node based coding. I had very minimal help from classmates or professors as this project was a semester long final project. We had the whole semester, but were tasked with giving weekly updates and showing off the progress we had. Overall this project was very fun to do and I was glad I did it. Although the finished project wasn't flawless it was a great learning experience! Here's a link to the documentation for the final project: <a href="<https://vimeo.com/167159553">NightTerror</a></p>
