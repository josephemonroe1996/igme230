        <p>This is a recreation of the classic Pong! This was coded from the ground up through p5JS. I started with a blank screen then progressively coded each individual screen. This game was actually pretty simple to make. There was a switch statement that activated when the mouse was clicked over either the "play", "help", or "quit" buttons. This activated the switch statement and changed what was displayed on the screen, allowing for a seemless transition. The hardest part of the project was getting the ball to interact correctly with the "pong sticks" or player objects. There was four sides of the player object that had to be individually coded to react to the ball in a different way. This took quite a while, but a friend ended up helping me finish that part! This project turned out pretty well and I enjoyed doing it.</p>
