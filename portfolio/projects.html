      <h2>Some of my projects!</h2>
        <div class="Project1">
        <img src="DM3nightterror.png" alt="Night Terror" class="center">
        <p>This is a prototype game I made for my capstone class at Tompkins Cortland Community College. I took the capstone class in my second semester as to graduate early. I was far behind my classmates in terms of experience, but a fellow student recommended I use Unreal Engine 4 to design a prototype game. So I took the idea and ran with it! Here's a link to the documentation for the final project: <a href="<https://vimeo.com/167159553">NightTerror</a></p>
      </div>
      <div class="Project2">
        <img src="IGMEpong.png" alt="IGME Pong" class="center">
        <p>This is a recreation of the classic Pong! This was coded from the ground up through p5JS. This project was done for IGME 102 and was pretty fun to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Project3">
          <img src="NMDEphotoshop.jpg" alt="NMDE photo 1" class="center">
          <img src="NMDEphotoshop2.jpg" alt="NMDE photo 2" class="center">
          <p>These two photos were a project for a design class called NMDE. Our task was to design a tattoo from the ground up, then photoshop it onto skin to make it look real. I was very pleased with the final outcome of this project!</p>
