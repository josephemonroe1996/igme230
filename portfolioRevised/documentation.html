        <h2>Documentation for this portfolio.</h2>
        <p>Creating this portfolio site was a fun task to undertake. The navigation button was shamelessly modeled after the one provided by W3Schools, a great place for HTML and CSS coding needs. Here's a link to the tutorial it was modeled after: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp">Dropdown Tutorial</a>. One particularly challenging aspect of designing this portfolio was alignment and color scheme. I spent multiple hours changing colors trying to decide if I wanted a darker shade of blue, or green, or silver, etc. I finally ended up landing on a grey analogous color scheme, but may change it in the future. Alignment on some parts threw me off, not that it was a difficult fix. It was just small things that drove me into OCD mode and I spent a fair amount of time making minute adjustments to the alignment of things. The intial design was modeled after the responsive design exercise done in week 5, but changed to fit my tastes. I enjoyed the idea of having the main information centered and having sub info off to the sides. </p>
