          <p>These two photos were a project for a design class called NMDE. Our task was to design a tattoo from the ground up, then photoshop it onto skin to make it look real. I started by deciding what kind of tattoo I wanted to design. I ended up settling on a tribal style wolf with a third eye design mixed in. After planning out the design in illustrator I made a few different versions of it, but settled on the one that is in the photos above. That design just felt right to me. Applying the tattoo to the skin was actually a simple process. Going through photoshop we had to edit the curvature of the tattoo to match the skin and change the opacity to blend the tattoo with the skin. I really enjoyed this project and it was my favorite one of the semester.</p>
